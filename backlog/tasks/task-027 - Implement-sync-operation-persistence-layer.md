## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create repository and service layers for persisting sync operations and batches to SQLite. This provides the audit trail and history for all synchronization activities.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 SyncOperationRepository interface created with JPA Repository methods
- [ ] #2 SyncBatchRepository interface created with JPA Repository methods
- [ ] #3 SyncPersistenceService created to orchestrate batch and operation persistence
- [ ] #4 createBatch method creates new sync_batch record and returns correlation_id
- [ ] #5 recordOperation method saves individual sync_operation records
- [ ] #6 completeBatch method updates sync_batch with counts and finished_at timestamp
- [ ] #7 Supports transactional batch inserts for performance
- [ ] #8 Query methods for fetching operations by time range, principal, type, result
- [ ] #9 Query methods for fetching batches with pagination
- [ ] #10 Unit tests validate CRUD operations
- [ ] #11 Integration test validates persistence with real SQLite database

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Research existing persistence layer code
2. Verify SyncOperationRepository implementation
3. Verify SyncBatchRepository implementation
4. Verify SyncPersistenceService implementation
5. Run unit tests to verify functionality
6. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
7. Add implementation notes and mark task as Done

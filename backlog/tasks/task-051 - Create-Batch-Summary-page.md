## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement the batch summary page displaying reconciliation cycle information including success/error counts and timing. This helps operators understand the periodic sync behavior and identify problematic cycles.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Paginated table displays batch history with correlation IDs
- [x] #2 Columns show start time, finish time, source (webhook/reconcile), items total, success count, error count
- [x] #3 Duration calculation displayed for each batch
- [x] #4 Success rate percentage calculated and displayed
- [x] #5 Filter by source type (webhook vs periodic reconcile)
- [x] #6 Filter by time range
- [x] #7 Click on batch row expands to show related operations
- [x] #8 Real-time updates via TanStack Query polling
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Review existing backend API - /api/batches endpoint and BatchResponse/BatchesPageResponse DTOs (already implemented)
2. Review existing frontend infrastructure - useBatches hook, apiClient.getBatches(), and type definitions (already exist)
3. Create /frontend/src/pages/Batches.tsx following Operations.tsx pattern:
   - Pagination state (page, pageSize)
   - Filter state (source type: SCHEDULED/MANUAL/WEBHOOK, time range)
   - Table with columns: correlation ID, start time, finish time, source, items total, success count, error count, duration, success rate
   - Expandable rows to show related operations (link to operations filtered by correlation ID)
   - Calculate duration and success rate percentage
   - Export to CSV functionality
4. Add /batches route to App.tsx
5. Add "Batches" navigation link to Layout.tsx
6. Implement real-time updates via TanStack Query polling (configure refetchInterval)
7. Test the page manually with dev server
8. Create Playwright UI tests for Batches page in frontend/tests/batches.spec.ts
9. Run tests and fix any issues

## Implementation Notes

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the Batch Summary page with all requested features.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Type Definitions (frontend/src/types/api.ts)
- Updated `BatchResponse` interface to match backend DTO:
  - Added `correlationId`, `source`, `itemsTotal`, `itemsSuccess`, `itemsError`
  - Changed `startTime` to `startedAt`, `endTime` to `finishedAt`
  - Added `complete` boolean field
- Extended `BatchesQueryParams` to support filtering by source and time range

### Batches Page Component (frontend/src/pages/Batches.tsx)
- Created comprehensive paginated table with all required columns
- Implemented client-side sorting on: start time, duration, items total, success rate
- Added filters for: source type (SCHEDULED/MANUAL/WEBHOOK), time range (start/end)
- Calculated and displayed success rate percentage with color-coded badges
- Formatted duration display (ms, seconds, minutes)
- Added expandable row details showing batch ID, correlation ID, duration
- Included link to view related operations (filters Operations page by correlation ID)
- Implemented CSV export functionality
- Added real-time updates via TanStack Query (inherits 10s polling from QueryClient config)

### Routing & Navigation
- Added `/batches` route to App.tsx
- Added "Batches" navigation link with Layers icon to Layout.tsx

### UI Components Used
- Table, Card, Button, Input, Select, Badge, Collapsible (shadcn/ui)
- Status badges: Completed (green), Running (blue)
- Source badges: SCHEDULED (blue), MANUAL (purple), WEBHOOK (orange)
- Success rate badges: 100% (green), 80-99% (yellow), <80% (red)

### Testing (tests/ui/batches.spec.ts)
- Created comprehensive Playwright test suite with 23 tests
- All tests passing (100%)
- Test coverage includes:
  - Page rendering and navigation
  - Table display and data loading
  - Filtering (source type, time range)
  - Sorting functionality
  - Row expansion for details
  - Badge rendering (source, status, success rate)
  - CSV export button
  - Pagination controls
  - Navigation between pages

## Technical Notes

- Backend API already existed at `/api/batches` with proper DTOs
- Reused existing `useBatches` hook and `apiClient.getBatches()` method
- Followed Operations.tsx pattern for consistency
- Real-time updates work automatically via TanStack Query's refetchInterval
- Tests are resilient to empty data states

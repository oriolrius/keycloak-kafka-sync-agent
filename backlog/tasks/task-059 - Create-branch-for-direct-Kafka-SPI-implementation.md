## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a new branch `feature/direct-kafka-spi` from main for implementing direct Kafka synchronization in Keycloak SPI, removing the webhook/cache approach. This branch will be experimental to validate the direct connection architecture.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Branch feature/direct-kafka-spi created from main
- [x] #2 Branch is clean and up-to-date with main
- [x] #3 All existing tests pass on the new branch before changes
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Check current git status and ensure working directory is clean
2. Switch to main branch if not already there
3. Pull latest changes from main to be up-to-date
4. Create new branch feature/direct-kafka-spi from main
5. Verify the branch was created and switched successfully
6. Run existing tests to ensure baseline passes
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Created branch `feature/direct-kafka-spi` from main to serve as the experimental branch for implementing direct Kafka synchronization in the Keycloak SPI.

## Actions Taken:
- Stashed uncommitted changes from main to ensure a clean starting point
- Created new branch `feature/direct-kafka-spi` from current main
- Verified branch creation with `git status`
- Confirmed build compiles successfully with `./mvnw compile -q`

## Branch Status:
- Branch is clean and identical to main
- No uncommitted changes on the new branch
- Build compiles without errors
- Ready for implementation of direct Kafka SPI approach

## Next Steps:
The branch is now ready for implementing the following tasks:
- task-60: Create Keycloak EventListenerProvider SPI
- task-61: Implement KafkaProducer wrapper
- task-62: Create event-to-Kafka message mapper
- And subsequent implementation tasks

## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a service that manages SCRAM credentials in Kafka using the AdminClient API. Supports listing, describing, upserting, and deleting SCRAM credentials.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 KafkaScramManager service created with AdminClient integration
- [x] #2 describeUserScramCredentials method returns map of principal to mechanisms
- [x] #3 alterUserScramCredentials method supports both upsert and delete operations
- [x] #4 Handles UserScramCredentialUpsertion for creating/updating credentials
- [x] #5 Handles UserScramCredentialDeletion for removing credentials
- [x] #6 Supports batch operations (multiple principals in single API call)
- [x] #7 Returns AlterUserScramCredentialsResult with per-principal futures
- [x] #8 Implements proper error handling for Kafka API exceptions
- [x] #9 Logs all operations with principal, mechanism, and operation type
- [x] #10 Unit tests with mocked AdminClient
- [x] #11 Integration test validates operations against real Kafka (Testcontainers)
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Research existing codebase structure for service placement and patterns
2. Review Kafka AdminClient API for SCRAM credential operations
3. Create KafkaScramManager service with CDI integration
4. Implement describeUserScramCredentials method
5. Implement alterUserScramCredentials method (upsert and delete)
6. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
7. Write unit tests with Mockito
8. Write integration test using Testcontainers
9. Verify all acceptance criteria are met

## Implementation Notes

## Implementation Summary

The KafkaScramManager service was already fully implemented in the codebase. This task focused on adding comprehensive test coverage:

### Unit Tests (KafkaScramManagerTest.java)
Created comprehensive unit tests using QuarkusMock to mock AdminClient and SyncMetrics:
- 12 test cases covering all SCRAM credential operations
- Tests for describe, upsert, delete operations (single and batch)
- Error handling scenarios (UnsupportedVersionException, ExecutionException, InterruptedException)
- Validates proper AdminClient method invocations and parameter passing
- Tests waitForAlterations helper method for async result handling

### Integration Tests (KafkaScramManagerIntegrationTest.java)
Created end-to-end integration tests using Testcontainers:
- 10 test cases validating operations against real Kafka broker
- Tests SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-512 mechanism support
- Validates upsert, update, delete operations
- Tests batch operations for multiple principals
- Validates per-principal future handling
- Tests multiple mechanisms per user scenario
- Includes proper cleanup between tests to ensure isolation

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed ReconciliationSchedulerTest.java to use QuarkusMock instead of unavailable @InjectMock annotation
- Updated both test files to work with Quarkus 3.29.0 testing patterns

### Test Results
- Unit tests: 12/12 passed
- Integration tests: 10/10 passed
- All acceptance criteria validated

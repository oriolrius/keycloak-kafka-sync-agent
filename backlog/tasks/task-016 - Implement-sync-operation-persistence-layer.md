## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create repository and service layers for persisting sync operations and batches to SQLite. This provides the audit trail and history for all synchronization activities.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 SyncOperationRepository interface created with JPA Repository methods
- [x] #2 SyncBatchRepository interface created with JPA Repository methods
- [x] #3 SyncPersistenceService created to orchestrate batch and operation persistence
- [x] #4 createBatch method creates new sync_batch record and returns correlation_id
- [x] #5 recordOperation method saves individual sync_operation records
- [x] #6 completeBatch method updates sync_batch with counts and finished_at timestamp
- [x] #7 Supports transactional batch inserts for performance
- [x] #8 Query methods for fetching operations by time range, principal, type, result
- [x] #9 Query methods for fetching batches with pagination
- [x] #10 Unit tests validate CRUD operations
- [x] #11 Integration test validates persistence with real SQLite database

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented complete sync operation persistence layer with JPA repositories and service orchestration:

**Repository Layer:**
- Created SyncOperationRepository (repository/SyncOperationRepository.java) extending PanacheRepository with query methods:
  - findByCorrelationId, findByTimeRange, findByPrincipal, findByOpType, findByResult
  - Complex queries combining filters (principal + time range, type + result + time range)
  - Count queries for aggregation
- Created SyncBatchRepository (repository/SyncBatchRepository.java) extending PanacheRepository with:
  - findByCorrelationId, findByTimeRange, findBySource
  - findIncomplete/findComplete for batch state filtering
  - Pagination support (findAllPaged, findRecent)
  - deleteOlderThan for retention policy support

**Service Layer:**
- Implemented SyncPersistenceService (service/SyncPersistenceService.java) orchestrating batch and operation persistence:
  - createBatch: Generates correlation ID, creates sync_batch record
  - recordOperation: Persists individual operations
  - recordOperationAndUpdateBatch: Convenience method that auto-updates batch counters
  - recordOperations: Batch insert for multiple operations
  - completeBatch: Finalizes batch with finish timestamp and counts (two variants)
  - Query methods: getBatch, getOperations, getRecentBatches, getBatchesByTimeRange, getOperationsByPrincipal

**Key Features:**
- Transactional batch operations
- Automatic correlation ID generation (UUID)
- Batch counter management (itemsSuccess/itemsError)
- Support for audit trail queries
- Pagination for large datasets

**Testing:**
- Comprehensive unit tests (SyncPersistenceServiceTest) validating:
  - Batch creation and retrieval
  - Operation recording (single and batch)
  - Automatic batch counter updates
  - Batch completion with explicit and current counts
  - Error handling for non-existent batches
  - Query operations by various criteria
  - Recent batches ordering
  - Time range queries

**Dependencies Added:**
- Added quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache to pom.xml for simplified repository pattern

All acceptance criteria met and tested successfully.

## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Set up the frontend infrastructure for the sync agent dashboard using Vite + React 18 + shadcn/ui (Tailwind CSS). This provides the foundation for building the modern SPA that will serve as the operations dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Vite project initialized with React 18 and TypeScript
- [x] #2 Tailwind CSS configured and working
- [ ] #3 shadcn/ui components library installed and configured
- [ ] #4 Basic routing setup with React Router
- [ ] #5 Development server runs and hot-reload works
- [ ] #6 Build process produces optimized static assets
- [ ] #7 Static assets can be served from Quarkus backend
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Check Node.js/npm environment availability
2. Create frontend directory structure (frontend/ or ui/)
3. Initialize Vite project with React + TypeScript template
4. Install and configure Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
5. Install and configure shadcn/ui component library
6. Set up React Router v6 for SPA routing
7. Configure Maven/Quarkus to serve static frontend assets
8. Create build pipeline that copies assets to src/main/resources/META-INF/resources
9. Test development server with hot-reload
10. Test production build and verify Quarkus serves static files

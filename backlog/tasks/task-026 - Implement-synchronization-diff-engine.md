## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create the diff engine that compares Keycloak users with Kafka SCRAM principals and computes the required synchronization operations (upserts and deletes).
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 SyncDiffEngine service created with computeDiff method
- [x] #2 Takes KeycloakUserInfo list and Kafka principal set as input
- [x] #3 Returns SyncPlan object containing lists of upserts and deletes
- [x] #4 Upsert identified when user exists in Keycloak but not in Kafka
- [x] #5 Upsert identified when user exists in both but credentials may be stale (configurable)
- [x] #6 Delete identified when principal exists in Kafka but not in Keycloak
- [x] #7 Filters out excluded principals (admin accounts, system accounts)
- [x] #8 SyncPlan includes counts and summary statistics
- [x] #9 Implements dry-run mode for validation without execution
- [x] #10 Unit tests validate diff logic with various scenarios (new users, deletions, no changes)
- [x] #11 Performance test validates handling of 10,000+ users

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Research existing codebase for SyncDiffEngine and related classes
2. Verify SyncDiffEngine service implementation is complete
3. Verify SyncPlan domain object implementation is complete
4. Run existing unit tests to verify functionality
5. Verify all acceptance criteria are met by existing implementation
6. Add implementation notes and mark task as Done

## Implementation Summary

The SyncDiffEngine and SyncPlan were already fully implemented in the codebase with comprehensive test coverage. This task involved verification of existing implementation and confirming all acceptance criteria are met.

### SyncDiffEngine Service (src/main/java/com/miimetiq/keycloak/sync/reconcile/SyncDiffEngine.java)

**Core Functionality:**
- `computeDiff(List<KeycloakUserInfo>, Set<String>, boolean)` - Main diff computation method
- Takes Keycloak users (source of truth) and Kafka principals (current state)
- Returns SyncPlan with upserts and deletes
- Supports dry-run mode for validation without execution

**Key Features:**
- **Configurable Upsert Strategy**: `reconcile.always-upsert` (default: true)
  - `true`: All Keycloak users are upserted (refreshes all credentials)
  - `false`: Only new users (not in Kafka) are upserted
- **Principal Exclusion**: Filters out system accounts (admin, kafka, zookeeper, system)
  - Configurable via `reconcile.excluded-principals`
  - Supports exact and prefix matching (e.g., "admin" excludes "admin-user")
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses Set-based lookups for O(1) principal checking
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Debug and info level logging for troubleshooting

**Diff Logic:**
1. Build Keycloak username set for fast lookups
2. Filter Kafka principals to exclude system accounts
3. Compute upserts (all users or only new users, based on config)
4. Compute deletes (orphaned Kafka principals not in Keycloak)
5. Return SyncPlan with statistics

### SyncPlan Domain Object (src/main/java/com/miimetiq/keycloak/sync/reconcile/SyncPlan.java)

**Structure:**
- Immutable lists of upserts (KeycloakUserInfo) and deletes (principal names)
- Dry-run flag for validation mode
- Summary statistics and human-readable summary string

**Features:**
- Immutable getters return defensive copies
- Counts: `getTotalOperations()`, `getUpsertCount()`, `getDeleteCount()`
- Utility: `isEmpty()`, `isDryRun()`, `getSummary()`
- Builder pattern for manual construction
- Proper equals/hashCode/toString implementations

### Test Coverage (src/test/java/com/miimetiq/keycloak/sync/reconcile/SyncDiffEngineTest.java)

**11 comprehensive unit tests covering:**
1. New users only (upserts)
2. Deleted users only (orphaned principals)
3. No changes (empty diff or all upserts based on config)
4. Mixed operations (new users + orphaned principals)
5. Excluded principals filtering
6. Dry-run mode
7. Empty inputs
8. Large dataset (10,000 users) - performance < 1 second
9. Immutable list enforcement
10. Builder pattern usage
11. Summary string generation

**Test Results:**
- All 11 tests pass ✅
- Performance test validates 10,000+ users in < 1 second
- Verifies immutability, exclusion filtering, and all diff scenarios

### Configuration Options

```properties
# Always upsert all Keycloak users (refresh credentials)
reconcile.always-upsert=true

# Comma-separated list of principals to exclude from sync
reconcile.excluded-principals=custom-admin,test-user
```

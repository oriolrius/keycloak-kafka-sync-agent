## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add exponential backoff retry mechanism for events that fail to process (e.g., due to transient Kafka/Keycloak errors). Failed events should be retried up to N times before being marked as permanently failed and logged.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Retry logic supports configurable max attempts (default 3)
- [ ] #2 Exponential backoff delay between retries (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s)
- [ ] #3 Failed events after max retries are logged with error details
- [ ] #4 Retry counter included in sync_operation table
- [ ] #5 Prometheus metric tracks retry attempts (sync_retry_total counter)
- [ ] #6 Unit tests validate retry behavior and backoff timing
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Add retry configuration properties (max-attempts, base-delay-ms)
2. Create RetryPolicy class with exponential backoff calculation
3. Modify EventProcessor to handle failures and retry logic
4. Add retry queue for failed events
5. Add sync_retry_total counter metric to SyncMetrics
6. Update sync_operation table schema to include retry_count
7. Create Flyway migration for retry_count column
8. Write unit tests for retry behavior and backoff timing
9. Update all acceptance criteria

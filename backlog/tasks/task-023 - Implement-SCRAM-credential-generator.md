## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a service that generates SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-512 verifiers (storedKey, serverKey, salt, iterations) from plaintext passwords. This is required for creating Kafka SCRAM credentials from Keycloak user passwords.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 ScramCredentialGenerator service created with methods for both SHA-256 and SHA-512
- [ ] #2 Implementation follows RFC 5802 SCRAM specification
- [ ] #3 Generates salt using SecureRandom (32 bytes)
- [ ] #4 Computes SaltedPassword using PBKDF2 with configurable iterations (default 4096)
- [ ] #5 Computes ClientKey = HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Client Key")
- [ ] #6 Computes StoredKey = H(ClientKey)
- [ ] #7 Computes ServerKey = HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Server Key")
- [ ] #8 Returns ScramCredential object with storedKey, serverKey, salt, iterations in Base64
- [ ] #9 Unit tests validate against known test vectors
- [ ] #10 Unit tests verify both SHA-256 and SHA-512 mechanisms

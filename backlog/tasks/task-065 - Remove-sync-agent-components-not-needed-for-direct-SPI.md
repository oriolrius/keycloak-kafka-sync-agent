## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
In the feature branch, remove or disable sync-agent components that are obsolete with direct Kafka SPI: webhook endpoint (PasswordWebhookResource), password cache, reconciliation triggers for password sync. Keep reconciliation as safety net for manual runs only. Be radical - remove everything that direct SPI makes unnecessary.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 PasswordWebhookResource removed or disabled
- [x] #2 Password cache removed from ReconciliationService
- [x] #3 Scheduled reconciliation kept as manual safety net only
- [x] #4 Sync-agent compiles without webhook/cache code
- [ ] #5 Docker compose still starts sync-agent successfully
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Search for PasswordWebhookResource class
2. Search for password cache in ReconciliationService
3. Search for scheduled reconciliation triggers
4. Remove/disable PasswordWebhookResource (AC #1)
5. Remove password cache from ReconciliationService (AC #2)
6. Convert scheduled reconciliation to manual-only (AC #3)
7. Compile sync-agent to verify no errors (AC #4)
8. Test docker compose startup (AC #5)
9. Document all changes in implementation notes

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully removed obsolete sync-agent components that are no longer needed with direct Kafka SPI architecture.

**Components Removed:**

1. **PasswordWebhookResource.java** (DELETED):
   - Removed entire class file: src/main/java/com/miimetiq/keycloak/sync/webhook/PasswordWebhookResource.java
   - This was the REST endpoint that received password events from Keycloak SPI via webhook
   - Contained in-memory password cache (PASSWORD_CACHE) that temporarily stored passwords
   - No longer needed because direct SPI syncs passwords immediately to Kafka during password changes

2. **Password cache usage in ReconciliationService.java** (CLEANED):
   - Removed lines 166-175 that accessed PasswordWebhookResource.getPasswordForUser()
   - Removed logic that tried to get "real" passwords from webhook cache
   - Simplified to ONLY use random passwords during reconciliation
   - Added comment explaining that direct SPI syncs real passwords immediately during changes
   - Reconciliation now only creates credentials for users that don't exist in Kafka

3. **Scheduled reconciliation** (DISABLED BY DEFAULT):
   - Changed ReconcileConfig.java schedulerEnabled() default from "true" to "false"
   - Added documentation explaining direct SPI makes scheduled sync unnecessary
   - Scheduled reconciliation now serves as manual-only safety net
   - Can be re-enabled via RECONCILE_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true environment variable if needed
   - Manual reconciliation trigger still works via REST endpoint

**Architecture Impact:**

With direct Kafka SPI:
- Password sync happens IMMEDIATELY when user changes password in Keycloak
- No webhook endpoint needed
- No password cache needed
- No scheduled polling needed
- Reconciliation becomes a safety net for edge cases (manual trigger only)

**Verification:**
- Sync-agent compiles successfully without removed components
- No compilation errors
- Manual reconciliation endpoint still functional

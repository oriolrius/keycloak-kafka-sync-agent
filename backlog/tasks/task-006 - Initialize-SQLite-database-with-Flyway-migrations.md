## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Set up SQLite database with Flyway for schema versioning. Create the initial migration (V1__init.sql) with tables for sync_operation, sync_batch, and retention_state as specified in the technical design.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Flyway is configured with SQLite JDBC driver
- [x] #2 Database file location is configurable via environment variable
- [x] #3 V1__init.sql migration creates sync_operation table with all columns and indexes
- [x] #4 V1__init.sql migration creates sync_batch table with all columns and indexes
- [x] #5 V1__init.sql migration creates retention_state table with initial row
- [x] #6 Migrations execute successfully on application startup
- [x] #7 Database schema matches specification in technical analysis
- [x] #8 SQLite connection is validated in health check
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Add Flyway and SQLite JDBC dependencies to pom.xml
2. Configure Flyway with SQLite datasource in application.properties
3. Make database file location configurable via SQLITE_DB_PATH environment variable
4. Create db/migration/V1__init.sql with all three tables and indexes
5. Enhance health check to validate SQLite connection
6. Test that migrations execute successfully on startup
7. Verify schema matches technical specification
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented SQLite database initialization with Flyway migrations successfully.

Changes made:
- Flyway and SQLite JDBC dependencies were already present in pom.xml (quarkus-flyway and quarkus-jdbc-sqlite)
- Updated application.properties to make database file location configurable via SQLITE_DB_PATH environment variable (defaults to sync-agent.db)
- Created V1__initial_schema.sql migration with all three required tables:
  * sync_operation table with 12 columns and 3 indexes (idx_sync_operation_time, idx_sync_operation_principal, idx_sync_operation_type)
  * sync_batch table with 8 columns and 1 index (idx_sync_batch_time)
  * retention_state table with single-row constraint and initial default values (max_age_days=30)
- SQLiteHealthCheck was already implemented with connection validation via SELECT 1 query
- Verified migrations execute successfully on startup via Flyway logs showing "Successfully applied 1 migration to schema main, now at version v1"
- Confirmed SQLite health check passes and returns UP status with "database: connected"

All tables match the specification from decision-001 Technical Analysis document.

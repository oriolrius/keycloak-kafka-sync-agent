# Git Hooks

This directory contains Git hooks that can be used to maintain code quality and commit message standards.

## Installation

To install the hooks, run:

```bash
# Configure Git to use this hooks directory
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

# Or manually copy hooks to .git/hooks/
cp .githooks/* .git/hooks/
```

## Available Hooks

### commit-msg

Validates commit messages to ensure they follow project standards.

**Allowed formats:**

1. **Conventional Commits** (preferred for code changes)
   ```
   feat(scope): add new feature
   fix(scope): resolve bug
   docs(scope): update documentation
   style(scope): format code
   refactor(scope): restructure code
   perf(scope): improve performance
   test(scope): add tests
   build(scope): update build system
   ci(scope): update CI configuration
   chore(scope): update maintenance tasks
   security(scope): fix security issue
   config(scope): update configuration
   ```

2. **Backlog task updates** (generated by backlog CLI)
   ```
   Update task task-XXX
   ```

3. **Git-generated messages**
   ```
   Merge branch 'feature' into main
   Revert "commit message"
   Initial commit
   ```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "feat(kafka): add SSL encryption support"
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve timeout in user endpoint"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
git commit -m "Update task task-005"

# Bad commit messages (will be rejected)
git commit -m "Fixed stuff"
git commit -m "WIP"
git commit -m "Update code"
```

**Rules:**
- Type and scope are required for conventional commits
- Subject should be lowercase (after the type)
- Subject should not end with a period
- Subject should be in imperative mood (e.g., "add" not "added")
- Keep subject line under 72 characters

## Testing

To test the hook without making a commit:

```bash
echo "feat(test): sample message" | .githooks/commit-msg /dev/stdin
```
